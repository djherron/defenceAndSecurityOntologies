# Cyber Security

The domain of **cyber-security** can be regarded as a subdomain of **information security**. This domain appears to be of particular interest to ontologists. The DISO cluster for `cyber-security` contains far more ontologies than any other cluster.

**Cyber-security** is about **information security** strictly within the **digital domain**.  That is, whereas **information security** takes a holistic view to ensuring all information assets are protected, regardless of format, **cyber-security** has the more specialised remit of securing assets against digital threats.
