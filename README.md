# Defence and Security Ontologies

This repository contains a collection of OWL ontologies relating to the themes (domains) of defence and security. 

The themes of defence and security have been granted relaxed definitions and broad interpretations. The connection between some of the ontologies in this collection and these themes may therefore appear tenuous.

The motivation for establishing this collection of ontologies has to do with the research problem of OWL **ontology alignment**.  The ambition is to use this collection to help create a new defence & security track for the [Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI)](https://oaei.ontologymatching.org/).  OAEI tracks contain one or more **ontology alignment tasks** --- pairs of ontologies with substantial domain overlaps that pose interesting ontology alignment challenges.

An ontology search exercise was undertaken during which the ontologies in this collection were identified and physically acquired. This search exercise was largely driven by ontological research literature.

Anticipated next steps:
* analyse the ontologies in this collection
* identify candidate pairs of ontologies for alignment tasks
* select a short-list of ontology pairs
* select a final (small) set of ontology pairs (alignment tasks)
* establish **reference alignments** for the final set of alignment tasks
* formally establish a new defence & security OAEI track
