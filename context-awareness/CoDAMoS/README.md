# CoDAMoS

## Overview

**CoDAMoS: Context-Driven Adaptation of Mobile Services**

**CoDAMoS** is designed for **pervasive computing**. It models **user, platform, environment, and service** information to enable **context-aware applications** that **adapt to dynamic situations**.

The idea is to facilitate services that are attentive, predictive, and responsive to users' real-time needs.

We obtained **CoDAMoS** only by a sort of fluke: it came as a component of the **BOnSAI** ontology (in the DISO `smart-buildings` cluster, within the `smart-environments` cluster)
