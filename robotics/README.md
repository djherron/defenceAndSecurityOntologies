# Robotics ontologies

The DISO `robotics` cluster of ontologies emerged largely due to our discovery of the **CORA** ontology (a network of ontologies for IEEE robotics standards).

The **OntoSecRPA** ontology, in the DISO `information-security` cluster, also addresses the robotics domain (Robotics Process Automation). **OntoSecRPA** is an example of an ontology that fits well in more than one DISO cluster. It sits in the `information-security` cluster simply because that is where it was first assigned.

So the DISO `robotics` cluster should be thought of as containing two ontologies, not one: **CORA** and **OntoSecRPA**.
