## Overview

**IES-core: IES Core Ontology**

IES-core is a mid-level ontology that accompanies Version 5 of the IES (Information Exchange Standard) ontology, released on GitHub in November 2025.

GitHub:
* https://github.com/IES-Org/ies-core
> A mid-level ontology built upon IES-Top providing a common foundational layer of patterns and concepts useful for expressing information in all manner of domains.

The physical ontology file for IES-core is called: `ies-core.ttl`

Within DISO, we store the `ies-core.ttl` ontology file with its companion IES ontology in the `information-exchange` subdomain (cluster) of ontologies.  We preferred this option to distributing IES-related assets across the DISO repository.  You can find `ies-core.ttl` there.
