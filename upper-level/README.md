# Upper-level ontologies

Per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_ontology), **upper-level ontologies** consist of abstract and general concepts that apply across domains. They thereby support broad **semantic interoperability** across multiple, lower-level, domain-specific ontologies. In general, the classes of a domain ontology should be **subclasses** of classes within an upper-level ontology.

Upper-level ontologies are referred to using many names, such as: upper-level, top-level, foundational, upper, foundation, core.

Upper-level ontologies are included in this repository because they feature prominently in the literature and in the ontologies we encountered during our search for ontologies relating to the domains of defence and security.  Some of the domain ontologies we have collected include alignments to upper level ontologies within their overall scope.

Certain upper-level ontologies inform the design of the **Top-level Ontology** (TLO) being designed to underpin the **Foundation Data Model** (FDM) of the **Information Management Framework** (IMF) of the UK's **National Digital Twin** (NDT) --- a national ecosystem of interoperating Digital Twins of physical-world entities, environments or processes. None of the upper-level ontologies we have acquired satisfy all of the requirements defined for the FDM's top-level ontology (TLO), but several of them come very close to doing so.
