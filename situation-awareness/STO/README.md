## Overview

**STO: Situation Theory Ontology**

paper:
* `Ontology-based Situation Awareness`, Kokar & Matheus, 2007
> a formalization of situations that is compatible with the interpretation of situation awareness in terms of human awareness as well as the situation theory of Barwise and Devlin.
> the situation theory of Barwise in terms of an OWL ontology

**STO** was created by the same people who authored the **SAWCore** situation awareness ontology, and who converted the JC3IEDM data model to a **JC3IEDM** OWL ontology.  The authors of these ontologies and associated papers all appear to be associated with a company named [VIStology, Inc.](https://vistology.com).

In some ways **STO** can be regarded as a successor to, or an evolution of, **SAWCore**.  There may be interesting overlap here.

**VIStology** builds ontology-based systems. It has partners and affiliates such as:
* Air Force Office of Scientific Research
* DARPA
* CUBRC (which authored the **CCO** mid-level ontologies)
* Raytheon
* BAE Systems
* U.S. Army
