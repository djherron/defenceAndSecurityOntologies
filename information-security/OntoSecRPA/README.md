## Overview

**OntoSecRPA: Security Ontology for Robotic Process Automation**

A security ontology for RPA (Robotic Process Automation) that describes RPA-specific:
* assets
* risks
* security
* threats
* vulnerabilities
* countermeasures

**OntoSecRPA** is an example of an ontology that fits well in more than one DISO cluster. Due its focus on the RPA domain, it may well overlap nicely with ontologies in the DISO `robotics` cluster. We store **OntoSecRPA** in the DISO `information-security` cluster simply because this is where it was first assigned.
