# CWE

## Overview 

**CWE: Common Weakness Enumeration**

website:
* https://cwe.mitre.org/
> A community-developed list of software and hardware weaknesses that can become vulnerabilities

> Knowing the weaknesses that result in vulnerabilities means software developers, hardware designers, and security architects can eliminate them before deployment, when it is much easier and cheaper to do so.

CWE is not normally available in OWL format. We obtained our copy of the `cwe.ttl` file from the SEPSES (Semantic Processing of Security Event Streams) research group at Technical University Vienna (https://sepses.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/) in relation to their **ICS Security KG**. 

The OWL ontology file for CWE that we have obtained for DISO, `cwe.ttl`, was created by the SEPSES team. The ontology file itself declares that this is an ontology to **represent CWE**. It also says:
> This ontology is developed based on the CWE resources extracted from MITRE CWE (https://cwe.mitre.org/) 

For safety, DISO users should regard the `cwe.ttl` ontology file as an expression of CWE, but not necessarily fully up-to-date with the latest version of CWE.

The DISO `cwe.ttl` is one component of the integrated ontology for the SEPSES **ICS Security KG**. See the DISO entry for **ICS-SEC-KG-ONTO** for more information on SEPSES and the **ICS Security KG**, and on the repo from where we obtained the DISO `cwe.ttl`.
