# JC3IEDM

## Overview

**JC3IEDM** is an ontology that fits in more than one DISO cluster. It is very much a **Situation Awareness** ontology, but it is also an **Information Exchange** ontology.  For **JC3IEDM**, see the DISO `information-exchange` cluster.


## Alignment with SAWCore

The paper 
`An Ontology-Based Integrated Approach to Situation Awareness for High-Level Information Fusion in C4ISR (Valiente, 2011).pdf` describes an alignment between **JC3IEDM** and **SAWCore**. Unfortunately, while the paper provides a fairly detailed description of the alignment, it's described informally, in relative natural language. Crucially, we weren't able to find a formal, downloadable expression of the alignment. It may, however, be possible to extract an alignment by reading the paper closely. It's not clear yet whether such an investment of effort would yield a reasonable return.
