> A top level ontology grounded in Extensional Four-Dimensionalism
> IES-Top is an RDF top-level ontology which is based on the BORO Foundational Ontology and grounded in Extensional 4-Dimensionalism. It is also grounded in Pluralities, the Pluriverse and Constructionalism.

The physical ontology file for IES-top is called: `ies-top.ttl`

Within DISO, we store the `ies-top.ttl` ontology file with its companion IES ontology in the `information-exchange` subdomain (cluster) of ontologies.  We preferred this option to distributing IES-related assets across the DISO repository.  You can find `ies-top.ttl` there.
